01 HTML CSS Git: Code Refactor\
This is a refactoring of the HTML and CSS to the Horiseon website.\
It may be viewed at: https://tom2u.github.io/horiseon/\
DIVs in the HTML have been changed to HTML5 semantic elements (MAIN, SECTION, ASIDE, etc.)\
Alt attributes in IMG elements have been added.\
Redundant CSS has been consolidated so that there are fewer rules.\
The default images ranged from 6MB to 13MB. They have been reduced in file size to allow easier loading.\
The W3 Structural Validator at https://validator.w3.org/nu/ (with the [x] Outline box checked) was used to verify the validity and structure of the HTML.\
